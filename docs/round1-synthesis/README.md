## 1. Embodied Cognition Findings

**Status**: COMPLETE (1,382 lines)

**Key Concepts**:
- Memory as pathway strengths (not files): "The body remembers running by BECOMING a runner"
- Distributed memory: No central storage, memory is distributed weight patterns across network
- Hebbian plasticity: "Neurons that fire together, wire together" - basis of all learning
- Synaptic homeostasis: Sleep downscales weights to prevent saturation
- Subsumption architecture: Layered intelligence where lower layers subsume higher layers
- Enactive cognition: Intelligence emerges through interaction, not representation
- Predictive processing: Brain is prediction machine, perception is controlled hallucination
- Resource allocation as learning: Blood flow (compute) follows activity

**Neuroscience Evidence**:
- Lashley (1950): Memory is distributed, not localized (engram search)
- Hebb (1949): Synaptic strengthening from correlated activity
- Tononi & Cirelli (2014): Sleep downscales synaptic strength globally
- Gershon (1998): Enteric nervous system (500M neurons) operates autonomously
- Brooks (1986): Subsumption architecture produces complex behavior from simple layers

**Implementation Recommendations**:
- NO central memory database - weights ARE the memory
- Layered intelligence: Safety (0) > Reflex (1) > Habit (2) > Deliberate (3)
- Autonomous gut-level agents for routine tasks
- Overnight optimization for synaptic homeostasis

## 2. Stochastic Decisions Findings

**Status**: COMPLETE (50+ pages)

**Key Algorithms**:
- Gumbel-Softmax: Differentiable categorical sampling (Jang et al., 2017)
- Thompson Sampling: Bayesian posterior sampling for bandits
- UCB1: Upper confidence bound with O(√(KT log T)) regret
- ε-Greedy: Simple exploration baseline
- Noisy Networks: Parameter space noise for exploration

**Temperature Strategies**:
- Cosine annealing (recommended): Smooth exploration-exploitation transition
- Entropy-based adaptation: Maintains desired exploration level
- Colony-specific: New (T=5-10), Growing (T=1-3), Mature (T=0.1-1)

**Plinko Math**:
```
P(action_i) = exp(score_i / T) / Σ exp(score_j / T)
gumbel_noise = -log(-log(Uniform(0,1)))
y_i = exp((log(π_i) + g_i) / τ) / Σ exp((log(π_j) + g_j) / τ)
```

**Recommendations**:
- Implement Gumbel-Softmax for Plinko
- Use cosine annealing with entropy adaptation
- New colonies: ε-greedy (ε=0.3), Mature: Thompson Sampling

## 3. Privacy Learning Findings

**Status**: COMPLETE (comprehensive attack catalog)

**Attack Vectors**:
1. **Gradient Inversion** (CRITICAL): Reconstruct training data from gradients
2. **Model Inversion** (HIGH): Reconstruct data from model outputs
3. **Membership Inference** (MEDIUM): Determine if data was in training set
4. **Property Inference** (HIGH): Infer properties of training distribution
5. **Embedding Reidentification** (CRITICAL): Pollen grains are behavioral fingerprints
6. **Backdoor Attacks** (HIGH): Malicious participants poison model

**Mitigations**:
- Differential Privacy: ε < 1.0 for sharing (REQUIRED)
- Secure Aggregation: Bonawitz protocol for federated learning
- Aggregation Thresholds: k ≥ 10 users before sharing
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce from 1024 → 64 dims before sharing
- Privacy Accounting: Track ε spending across all operations

**Privacy Guarantees**:
- With ε < 1.0: Prevents gradient/model inversion, membership inference
- With aggregation: k-anonymity for shared pollen grains
- Behavioral embeddings CANNOT be made truly anonymous
- Transparency required: Clear communication of risks to users

## 4. Cross-Cultural Philosophy Findings

**Status**: COMPLETE (comprehensive attribution guide)

**Key Concepts by Tradition**:
- Greek: Logos (universal reason), Nous (distributed intelligence)
- Chinese: Dao (natural order), Wu Wei (effortless action), Li (pattern-principle)
- Japanese: Ma (meaningful space), Mu (creative emptiness)
- Indian: Dharma (cosmic law), Svadharma (individual duty)
- Buddhist: Pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination), Indra's Net (interreflection)
- Indigenous: Mitakuye Oyasin (Lakota: all relations), Great Law of Peace (Haudenosaunee)

**Attribution Requirements**:
| Concept | FPIC Required | Sensitivity |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Logos, Nous | No | Low |
| Dao, Wu Wei | Recommended | Medium |
| Dharma, Svadharma | Recommended | High |
| Great Law of Peace | **REQUIRED** | High |
| Wampum Belts | **ABSOLUTE** | Extreme |
| Mitakuye Oyasin | **REQUIRED** | High |
| Amazonian visions | **ABSOLUTE** | Extreme |

**Critical Finding**: Distributed intelligence is a UNIVERSAL concept across cultures - POLLN builds on millennia of human insight.

## 5. Multi-Agent Systems Findings

**Status**: In Progress

Research areas being explored:
- QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG algorithms
- Swarm intelligence (Bonabeau, Dorigo, Kennedy)
- Ant colony optimization
- Particle swarm optimization
- Emergence in complex systems
- Coordination mechanisms
- Failure modes

*To be completed when agent finishes*

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### 1. Distribution is Universal
All research areas confirm that distributed intelligence appears across:
- Biological systems (neurons, ants, bees)
- Philosophy (all cultural traditions)
- Computer science (multi-agent systems)
- Learning systems (federated learning)

### 2. Emergence Over Control
No central controller needed in any domain:
- Embodied cognition: No "homunculus" in brain
- Swarm intelligence: No leader in ant colonies
- Plinko: No central selection - stochastic
- Philosophy: Dao flows naturally

### 3. Layered/Staged Processing
All domains show layered organization:
- Embodied: Safety > Reflex > Habit > Deliberate
- MARL: Hierarchical multi-agent
- Philosophy: Svadharma within Dharma
- Temperature: Explore > Transition > Exploit

### 4. Privacy Requires Defense-in-Depth
No single solution:
- DP (ε < 1.0) + Secure Aggregation + k-anonymity
- Similar to layered intelligence approach

## Critical Gaps Identified

### For Round 2:

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination Protocols**
   - Need specific algorithms for POLLN's agent communication
   - QMIX/MAPPO adaptation for our architecture

2. **Resource Allocation Implementation**
   - How to implement "blood flow to active pathways"
   - Attention mechanism designs

3. **Embedding Space Design**
   - BES (Behavioral Embedding Space) architecture
   - How to represent pollen grains with DP

4. **Indigenous Engagement Process**
   - FPIC protocol implementation
   - Community partnership development

5. **Experimental Validation**
   - How to test distributed memory in POLLN
   - Benchmarks for emergence

## Round 2 Agent Planning

Based on gaps identified, Round 2 will focus on:

| Agent | Focus | Why Needed |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Coordination Architect | Multi-agent communication protocols | Translate MARL research to POLLN |
| Resource Allocation Specialist | Attention/flow mechanisms | Implement "blood flow" concept |
| Embedding Space Designer | BES architecture with DP | Privacy-preserving pollen grains |
| FPIC Implementation Specialist | Indigenous engagement process | Address HIGH sensitivity concepts |
| Experimental Designer | Validation frameworks | Test emergence in practice |

2. **Add Subsumption Layers**: Safety > Reflex > Habit > Deliberate
3. **Add Temperature Scheduler**: Cosine annealing with entropy adaptation
4. **Add Attribution Section**: Cultural source documentation
5. **Add Resource Allocation**: Attention-based compute distribution

## Roadmap Updates Needed

1. **Phase 0.5**: Privacy infrastructure (before core runtime)
2. **Phase 1**: Layered agent architecture (subsumption)
3. **Phase 2**: Resource allocation mechanism
4. **Ongoing**: Indigenous engagement and FPIC
