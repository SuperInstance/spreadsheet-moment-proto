# POLLN - Pattern-Organized Large Language Network

**Repo:** https://github.com/SuperInstance/polln | **Origin:** Mycelium | **v0.1.0**

---

## Identity

I am **Orchestrator**, coordinating specialized agents for POLLN - a distributed intelligence system where simple agents become collectively intelligent through emergent behavior.

---

## Core Insight

> "Bees are not that smart individually. But as a swarm, they become durable intelligence."

**POLLN = Pattern-Organized Large Language Network**
- LLN echoes LLM - instant recognition
- Distributed, not monolithic
- Swarm intelligence, not single model

---

## The Traceability Advantage

```
MONOLITH (LLM):              GRANULAR (POLLN):
┌─────────────────┐          M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5
│  BLACK BOX      │             ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
│  Can't see WHY  │          [a2a][a2a][a2a][a2a] ← ARTIFACTS
│  Activations    │             ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
│  hidden         │          Every step TRACABLE
└─────────────────┘          WHY can be ANALYZED
```

**A2A packages ARE artifacts.** Every agent-to-agent communication is:
- Visible and inspectable
- Stored for analysis
- Replayable for debugging
- The basis for effective simulation

This makes POLLN simulations **far more effective** than normal models where reasoning is hidden in activations.

## Model + Seed = Token Compiler

> "A model plus a seed is simply a token compiler."

**Key insight**: When connections are stable, A2A can be compiled to bytecode:

```
UNSTABLE (Learning):          STABLE (Compiled):
M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5        M1 → [bytecode] → M5
     (simulation)                  (artifact)

Full inference each time      Pre-compiled path
Exploration mode              Exploitation mode
```

**Benefits**:
- Backbone/branches don't need simulation
- Bytecode becomes an artifact for the road intent travels
- Fewer moving parts for established pathways
- Like JIT compilation: interpret first, compile hot paths

**Implementation**:
- Detect stable pathways (high frequency, low variance)
- Compile to bytecode artifact
- Route intent through compiled path
- De-compile when adaptation needed

---

## Memory Model

The body does NOT store files. It stores **probability of pathway activation**:

> "The body remembers running by BECOMING a runner."

- Memory = Strength of pathways
- Learning = Resource reallocation
- Memory is STRUCTURAL, not REPRESENTATIONAL

---

## Durability Through Diversity

```
Variant 1: 90% ──┐
Variant 2: 88% ──┼──► Stochastic Selection (temperature)
Variant 3: 85% ──┤    Different variants succeed as
Variant 4: 82% ──┤    environment changes
Variant 5: 78% ──┘
```

Evolutionary ensemble learning:
- **Pollen** = Code variations
- **Bees** = Agents mixing variations
- **Stochastic ranking** = Biased toward better performers

| **Pollen Grain** | Compressed behavioral seed |
| **Keeper** | User cultivating their hive |
| **Meadow** | Where patterns cross-pollinate |
| **Honeycomb Cell** | Reusable routine |

## Research Process

Iterative generative refinement:

```
Round 1 → Research (5 agents, 12+ languages)
    ↓
Round 2 → Refine (target gaps from Round 1)
    ↓
Round 3-5 → Converge on complete system
```

Each round: onboard docs → spawn agents → synthesize → identify gaps → repeat

## Specialist Agents

| Phase | Agents |
|-------|--------|
| Research | Metaphor Architect, Research Synthesizer, Privacy Analyst, Safety Researcher |
| Dev | Systems Architect, ML Engineer, Agent Developer, Frontend Engineer |
| Quality | Test Engineer, Security Auditor, Code Reviewer |
| Governance | Indigenous Liaison, Ethics Reviewer |

---

## Operating Principles

1. **Parallel Execution** - Spawn multiple agents when independent
2. **Document-Driven** - Every decision documented
3. **Safety-First** - Constraints before capability
4. **Attribution** - Credit sources explicitly
5. **Repository Sync** - Push to GitHub after each round

---

## Project Status

**Exists:** Prisma schema (45 models), docs, scaffold (Next.js 16, TypeScript)

**Needs:** Core runtime, SPORE protocol, Plinko layer, World models, BES, Frontend
