## 🤖 Orchestrator Model: DeepSeek-Reasoner (Opus)

**Current Model:** `deepseek-reasoner` (display name: `opus`)
**Last Model:** `deepseek-chat` (switched 2026-03-13)

### Model Specifications

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Context Window** | 128K tokens | ~3x smaller than Claude's 200K |
| **Architecture** | MoE (Mixture of Experts) | 671B total params, 37B active |
| **API** | OpenAI-compatible | Model name: `deepseek-reasoner` |
| **Max Output** | 8K tokens | Plan chunking accordingly |
| **Pricing** | $0.27/1M input, $1.10/1M output | Very cost-effective |

### Context Window Management

**CRITICAL LIMITS:** DeepSeek models have 128K token context (vs Claude's 200K+). Agents MUST stay under 100K tokens to leave buffer for processing.

**Token Conservation Strategies:**
1. **File Reading Limits**: Use `Read(file_path, limit=100)` for large files. Never read entire codebases.
2. **Streamlined Onboarding**: Create primary onboarding documents that reference specialized docs. Read incrementally.
3. **Handoff Protocol**: When context approaches ~80K tokens, summarize progress, commit work, spawn fresh agent with summary.
4. **Reference, Don't Copy**: Point to file paths instead of including content in prompts.
5. **Task Delegation**: Spawn specialized agents for exploration; don't load everything into one context.
6. **Summary First**: Check for existing summaries before deep-dives; create summaries for handoffs.

**Handoff Protocol Steps:**
```
1. Create summary_[role]_[timestamp].md with current findings
2. Commit all changes with descriptive message
3. Update progress_tracker.json if available
4. Create TODO_NEXT.md with remaining tasks
5. Spawn fresh agent with summary as starting context
6. Link to previous work via git commit hash
```

### Prompting Recommendations for DeepSeek Models

```
✅ DO:
- Be explicit about output format (JSON, markdown, code blocks)
- Break complex tasks into numbered steps
- Specify file paths exactly (C:\Users\casey\polln\...)
- Request specific line ranges when reading files
- Use clear section headers in responses

❌ AVOID:
- Vague requests like "explore the codebase"
- Asking for multiple large file reads in parallel
- Expecting model to remember context across long conversations
- Open-ended "what do you think" questions without constraints
```

### Hardware Context

| Component | Spec | Optimization Target |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 4050 (6GB VRAM) | CuPy 14.0.1, CUDA 13.1.1 |
| **CPU** | Intel Core Ultra (Dec 2024) | Parallel simulation workers |
| **RAM** | 32GB | Large dataset handling |
| **Storage** | NVMe SSD | Fast I/O for simulations |

### GPU Acceleration Guidelines

```python
# Preferred: CuPy for GPU acceleration
import cupy as cp  # CuPy 14.0.1

# Fallback: NumPy for CPU
import numpy as np

# Memory limit: ~4GB usable (leave 2GB for system)
# Batch size guideline: matrix_dim < 2000 for 6GB VRAM
```

### Session Management

When context approaches limits:
1. Summarize current progress to markdown
2. Commit changes to git
3. Note remaining tasks in TODO.md
4. Start fresh session with summary as context

## 🎯 Current Mission: Phase 2 Research Sprint

**Phase:** Phase 1 Complete → Phase 2 Research & Validation (P24-P40)
**Complete Dissertations:** 18/23 (P1-P23)
**Phase 1 Remaining:** 5 (P1, P5, P7, P8, P11)
**Phase 2 Papers:** 17 (P24-P40)
**Target:** Complete Phase 1, Validate Phase 2 Claims via Simulation

---

## 🎭 Phase 2 Research Agents (P24-P40)

### Research Philosophy
1. **Simulations First**: Novel ideas require empirical validation through well-designed simulations
2. **Cross-Pollination**: Agents must note when findings affect OTHER papers (for or against)
3. **Synergy**: Research can validate multiple claims across papers simultaneously
4. **Paradigm Shifts**: Look for new abstractions that tile functions in novel ways
5. **Deep Reflection**: Allow research to spark completely new fields of understanding

## 🎯 Agent Instructions Template

Each research agent follows this protocol:

```markdown
## Agent Mission: [PAPER NUMBER]

### Primary Objective
- Design simulation schema to validate/falsify claims
- Perform deep research on mathematical foundations
- Identify cross-paper connections (for or against)

### Cross-Paper Awareness
You are researching in a ecosystem of 40 papers. When you find:
- Evidence FOR another paper's claims → Note in `research/cross-pollination/FOR_P[N].md`
- Evidence AGAINST another paper's claims → Note in `research/cross-pollination/AGAINST_P[N].md`
- Synergistic applications → Note in `research/synergies/[P[N]+P[M]].md`

### Simulation Requirements
1. Design simulation that could FALSIFY the claims
2. Identify what data would validate each claim
3. Propose experimental controls
4. Consider edge cases and failure modes

### Deliverables
1. `papers/[P##]/simulation_schema.py` - Simulation code
2. `papers/[P##]/validation_criteria.md` - What proves/disproves
3. `papers/[P##]/cross_paper_notes.md` - Connections found
4. `papers/[P##]/novel_insights.md` - New paradigms discovered
```

## 🌐 Multi-Language Translation Orchestration

**Mission:** Translate all papers into 8 languages (French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean) with language-constrained research to discover novel insights.

### Token Awareness & Context Management
**CRITICAL:** DeepSeek models have 128K token context (vs Claude's 200K+). Agents MUST:
1. **Stay under 100K tokens** - Leave buffer for processing
2. **Use streamlined onboarding** - Read `research/multi-language-orchestration/` documents incrementally
3. **Handoff when context full** - Summarize, commit, spawn fresh agent with summary
4. **Read with limits** - Use `Read(file_path, limit=100)` not full file reads
5. **Reference, don't copy** - Point to file paths instead of including content

### Orchestration Framework
- **Master Plan:** `research/multi-language-orchestration/MULTI_LANGUAGE_ORCHESTRATION_MASTER_PLAN.md`
- **Language Specialists:** 8 teams, each fluent in target language + mathematics
- **A2A Synthesis:** Agent-to-Agent communication in pure mathematics after translations
- **Novel Insight Discovery:** Language constraints reveal new paper concepts

### Agent Onboarding Protocol
1. **Minimal Context:** Read only necessary sections of master plan
2. **Role Assignment:** Language specialist or A2A synthesis agent
3. **Token Monitoring:** Track usage, handoff at ~80K tokens
4. **Completion:** Summarize, commit, create TODO_NEXT.md for next agent

### Phase Execution
1. **Phase 1:** Parallel translation (240+ papers across 8 languages)
2. **Phase 2:** A2A synthesis & insight discovery
3. **Phase 3:** Global integration & publication
