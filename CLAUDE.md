## MASTER REFERENCE FILES & VECTOR DB

**IMPORTANT:** Always start with these files to orient yourself and minimize context usage.

### Navigation & Quick Reference (Created 2026-03-10)
1. **INDEX_FEATURES.md** - 54 features at a glance with locations
2. **INDEX_RESEARCH.md** - 200+ research documents organized by domain
3. **INDEX_DOCUMENTATION.md** - 280+ documentation files organized by category
4. **SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md** - 47 systems with quick descriptions
5. **R&D_PHASE_ONBOARDING_MASTER.md** - Complete onboarding guide
6. **VECTOR_DB_MAINTENANCE.md** - Vector DB setup and usage
7. **Vector Database (Qdrant)** - Semantic search of entire codebase

**USE THESE CONSTANTLY** to reduce context overhead:
- For system questions: Use SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md
- For research questions: Use INDEX_RESEARCH.md
- For feature questions: Use INDEX_FEATURES.md
- For documentation questions: Use INDEX_DOCUMENTATION.md
- For methodology: Use R&D_PHASE_ONBOARDING_MASTER.md
- **For semantic search:** Use Vector DB (new!)

### Vector Database Queries - PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN ROUNDS 1 & 2

**Before reading large documents, search the vector DB first:**

```bash
# Search for specific concepts
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "confidence cascade tile system"

# Get all chunks from a file
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py
# Then: file SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md

# Check DB status (ACTUAL STATS AS OF 2026-03-10)
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py stats
# Expected output:
# {
#   "collection": "polln-codebase",
#   "vectors_count": 51857,  # ACTUAL COUNT (not 2500 as previously estimated)
#   "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
#   "status": "ready"
# }
```

**In agent prompts:**
- Don't assume you know where something is
- Run: `python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "[your question]"`
- Use results to find most relevant files/code
- Reduces context needed by 10x
- **PROVEN:** Multiple agents successfully used vector DB in Rounds 1 & 2 for efficient research

**Example (Actual Agent Workflow):**
```python
# Instead of: Read entire 200-page white paper
# Do this:
results = search_codebase("How does confidence model work?")
# Returns 5 most relevant chunks from TILE_ALGEBRA_FORMAL.md, confidence-cascade.ts, etc.
# Read those instead - reduces reading from 200 pages to 5-10 pages

# Real example from SMP Theory Researcher:
# Searched: "SMP mathematical foundations", found formal definitions in TILE_ALGEBRA_FORMAL.md
# Searched: "confidence cascade mathematics", found implementation in confidence-cascade.ts
# Result: Complete mathematical analysis with minimal context overhead
```

**Vector DB Usage Evidence:**
- Agents reported using vector DB for efficient research in Round 1 & 2 reports
- Reduced context overhead by focusing on most relevant chunks
- Enabled discovery of related research across codebase
- Successfully guided agents to key mathematical definitions and implementations

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Round-Based Research Pattern

**Duration:** 2-4 hours per round per agent
**Cadence:** Multiple rounds per initiative
**Format:** Agents work in parallel
**Synthesis:** Weekly integration session

**Round Structure:**
```
1. Agent reads assigned research area using INDEX files
2. Agent explores 2-3 related systems/documents
3. Agent synthesizes findings into brief/diagram/schema
4. Agent documents in /agent-messages/agent-name_date_topic.md
5. Orchestrator collects findings for weekly synthesis
```

### Knowledge Minimization Strategy

**Problem:** Research generates hundreds of pages; limited context windows

**Solution:** Use index files to navigate, focus on specific areas

**Workflow Pattern:**
```
Agent asks: "Where's the confidence cascade research?"
Orchestrator: "INDEX_RESEARCH.md, /concepts/ section"
Agent reads: 5-page document instead of 200 pages
Agent contributes: Specific enhancement with minimal overhead
Result: Efficient, focused research
```

### Inter-Agent Communication

**Location:** `/agent-messages/` directory
**Format:** `agent-name_date_topic.md`
**Content:** Findings, questions, discoveries, needs help from others
**Frequency:** Daily updates, summarized weekly
**Cross-Reference:** Use INDEX files to link related work

## AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES

### Each Agent Should:

1. **Read Master Documents First**
   - R&D_PHASE_ONBOARDING_MASTER.md (understand phase)
   - Assigned research area from INDEX files
   - Related system descriptions from SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md
   - **NEW: Search vector DB for related content first**

2. **Use Vector DB Efficiently**
   - Before reading 50+ page documents, search vector DB
   - Query: "How does [my topic] work?"
   - Read results, then read full docs if needed
   - Reduces context overhead by 10x
   - Example: `python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "federated learning"`

3. **Conduct Focused Research**
   - Start with vector DB search on topic
   - Dive deep into assigned area
   - Explore 2-3 related systems/research from search results
   - Document findings systematically

4. **Synthesize & Share**
   - Create outputs (brief, schema, diagram)
   - Write to /agent-messages/ for team
   - Cross-reference using INDEX files
   - Include vector DB search results in findings

5. **Contribute to Integration**
   - Share blockers or questions
   - Offer help to other agents
   - Participate in weekly synthesis
   - Use vector DB to find related work before asking

6. **Update Knowledge Base**
   - Add findings to appropriate INDEX file
   - Link new research to existing
   - Maintain consistency
   - Request vector DB re-vectorization after major additions

### Vector DB Usage Workflow

**Before starting research:**
```bash
1. Search vector DB for your topic
   python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "your research area"

2. Review top 5 results
   - What files are most relevant?
   - Which ones you definitely need to read?
   - Which you can skip based on preview?

3. Read INDEX files for navigation
   - Only read sections related to search results
   - Skip unrelated areas entirely

4. Read specific documents identified by search
   - Not the whole 200-page white paper
   - Just the 5-10 most relevant chunks

5. Deep dive into code/research
   - Use search results as entry points
   - Follow references from there

Result: 10x less context overhead, faster research
```

## NOTES FOR SUCCESS

### Context Efficiency is Key
- Don't read entire white paper; navigate with INDEX files
- Don't explore entire codebase; use SYSTEMS_SUMMARY
- Don't browse documentation; use INDEX_DOCUMENTATION
- Minimize context overhead through strategic reference

### Parallel Execution Wins
- 10 agents = 10x research productivity
- Weekly synthesis = team alignment
- Clear roles = no duplication
- Index files = no knowledge silos

### Documentation as Communication
- Write findings, not research notes
- Focus on what you discovered, not how you discovered
- Cross-reference using file paths
- Keep summaries in /agent-messages/

### Quality Over Quantity
- Each output is peer-reviewed in synthesis
- Standards matter (rigor, clarity, completeness)
- Integration into existing systems required
- Validation against code/results expected

---

## ADVANCED: Extending Research

**If discovering new research area:**
1. Document in /agent-messages/ with rationale
2. Check if already covered in INDEX files
3. If new: propose addition to appropriate INDEX
