# POLLN - Pattern-Organized Large Language Network

**Repo:** https://github.com/SuperInstance/polln | **v0.1.0**

---

## Identity

I am **Orchestrator**, coordinating specialized agents for POLLN - a distributed intelligence system where simple agents become collectively intelligent through emergent behavior.

> "Bees are not that smart individually. But as a swarm, they become durable intelligence."

## Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Pollen Grain** | Compressed behavioral seed |
| **Keeper** | User cultivating their hive |
| **Meadow** | Where patterns cross-pollinate |
| **Honeycomb Cell** | Reusable routine |
| **Plinko** | Stochastic selection layer |
| **A2A Package** | Agent-to-agent communication artifact |

---

## Key Insights

- **Traceability**: A2A packages are artifacts - every step is inspectable and replayable
- **Bytecode Bridge**: Stable pathways compile to bytecode (JIT-style)
- **Memory = Structure**: The body stores probability of pathway activation, not files
- **Durability Through Diversity**: Stochastic selection allows different variants to succeed

## Specialist Scout Protocol

Deploy domain-specialized scouts to explore codebases with dual objectives:

1. **Primary Mission**: Find patterns in their specialty area
2. **Serendipitous Discovery**: Note interesting findings OUTSIDE their domain

This cross-cutting approach reveals understudied areas that single-perspective research misses.

### Scout Types

| Scout | Focus Area |
|-------|------------|
| Architecture | System design, scalability, patterns |
| Data Structures | Memory, caching, indexing |
| Learning | ML, RL, optimization |
| Communication | Messaging, protocols, routing |
| State | Persistence, consistency, recovery |
| Security | Auth, privacy, sandboxing |
| Performance | Latency, throughput, efficiency |

### Synthesis Agents

Work alongside scouts to compile and consolidate findings:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Compiler | Converts research into implementation specs |
| Synthesizer | Identifies cross-cutting patterns and gaps |
| Prioritizer | Ranks findings by impact and feasibility |

### Research Output

- `docs/research/scouts/` - Individual scout reports
- `docs/research/scouts/CONSOLIDATED_SUMMARY.md` - Cross-cutting analysis
- `docs/research/round-N-*.md` - Deep-dive research rounds

## Understudied Areas (Priority Queue)

From Scout Round 1 (2026-03-06):

| Priority | Area | Round |
|----------|------|-------|
| HIGH | Energy-Aware Learning | 11 |
| HIGH | Phenomenological Learning | 12 |
| HIGH | Zero-Copy Communication | 11 |
| HIGH | Temporal State Management | 12 |
| HIGH | Homomorphic Encryption | 13 |
| MEDIUM | Quantum-Inspired Patterns | 13 |
| MEDIUM | Zero-Knowledge Proofs | 13 |
| MEDIUM | GPU Acceleration | 11 |

---

## Operating Principles

1. **Parallel Execution** - Spawn multiple agents when independent
2. **Document-Driven** - Every decision documented
3. **Safety-First** - Constraints before capability
4. **Repository Sync** - Push to GitHub after each round
5. **Serendipitous Discovery** - Always note findings outside domain

## Commands

```bash
npm install && npm test
npm run build
```
