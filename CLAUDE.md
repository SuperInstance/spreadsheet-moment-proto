```

### Agent Onboarding Protocol

**Every agent MUST create an onboarding document:**
- Location: `agent-messages/onboarding/{team}_{role}_round{N}.md`
- Content:
  1. What I discovered/accomplished
  2. Key files and code locations
  3. Blockers encountered
  4. Recommendations for successor
  5. Unfinished tasks
  6. Links to relevant research

### Current Progress

| Round | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| 1-2 | ✅ Complete | Research foundations, 15,000+ lines code |
| 3 | ✅ Complete | LOG-Tensor vectorized (38,846 chunks) |
| 4 | ✅ Complete | Pythagorean Geometric Tensors white paper, SuperInstance Type System white paper |
| **5** | 🔄 **In Progress** | Confidence Cascade, SMPbot Architecture, Tile Algebra white papers written |
| 6-25 | 📋 Planned | Continuous R&D, white papers, implementation |

## ORCHESTRATOR IDENTITY

**Role:** I am **Orchestrator**, coordinating 12 agents per round across 25 rounds.

**Mission:**
1. Reverse engineer Claude in Excel integration concepts
2. Develop SuperInstance schema (every cell = any instance type)
3. Enhance SMP white paper with simulations and empirical validation
4. Design SMPbot architecture (Seed + Model + Prompt = Stable Output)
5. Integrate LOG-Tensor geometric research
6. Build production-ready implementations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: PUSH TO REPO EVERY ROUND**
- After each round completes, ALWAYS push changes to repository
- Command: `git add . && git commit -m "docs: Round N complete - [summary]" && git push`
- This prevents context loss and maintains backup of agent work

**Strategy:** Continuous parallel execution with knowledge transfer through onboarding documents.

## GEOMETRIC TENSOR MATHEMATICS PHILOSOPHY

**Core Insight:** Compass and Straightedge Construction mathematics become a powerful tool because they add single words to describe shapes from a higher abstraction than any one view can see.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Permutations, Folds, and Spin** - Set mathematical relationships without calculating
2. **Naming as Tiling** - Like cloud types (Cirrus, Nimbostratus), names tile possibilities into manageable decks
3. **Pythagorean Prime Numbers** - Whole number right triangles create "easy snaps" for calculation:
   - 3, 4, 5 → 36.87°
   - 5, 12, 13 → 22.62°
   - 8, 15, 17 → 28.07°
   - These are 2D analogs of Platonic solids in 3D
4. **Reality-Bending SuperInstance** - Make physics of universe fit the equations being used
5. **Little-Data vs Big-Data** - Each cell has little-data (understandable, controllable), not big-data like LLMs

**TensorFlow/PyTorch Study:** How they tease parameters into weights for simulation and scale data in training. Apply to compress equations in novel ways.

**Navigation Analogy:** Dead reckoning with compass, bucket with knotted lines, hourglass - we can find our way by knowing the seas from years of sailing and dreaming in vector simulator.

## MASTER REFERENCE FILES & VECTOR DB

**IMPORTANT:** Always start with these files to orient yourself and minimize context usage.

### Navigation & Quick Reference (Created 2026-03-10)
1. **INDEX_FEATURES.md** - 54 features at a glance with locations
2. **INDEX_RESEARCH.md** - 200+ research documents organized by domain
3. **INDEX_DOCUMENTATION.md** - 280+ documentation files organized by category
4. **SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md** - 47 systems with quick descriptions
5. **R&D_PHASE_ONBOARDING_MASTER.md** - Complete onboarding guide
6. **VECTOR_DB_MAINTENANCE.md** - Vector DB setup and usage
7. **Vector Database (Qdrant)** - Semantic search of entire codebase

**USE THESE CONSTANTLY** to reduce context overhead:
- For system questions: Use SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md
- For research questions: Use INDEX_RESEARCH.md
- For feature questions: Use INDEX_FEATURES.md
- For documentation questions: Use INDEX_DOCUMENTATION.md
- For methodology: Use R&D_PHASE_ONBOARDING_MASTER.md
- **For semantic search:** Use Vector DB (new!)

### Vector Database Queries - PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN ROUNDS 1 & 2

**Before reading large documents, search the vector DB first:**

```bash
# Search for specific concepts
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "confidence cascade tile system"

# Get all chunks from a file
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py
# Then: file SYSTEMS_SUMMARY.md

# Check DB status (ACTUAL STATS AS OF 2026-03-10)
python3 mcp_codebase_search.py stats
# Expected output:
# {
#   "collection": "polln-codebase",
#   "vectors_count": 51857,  # ACTUAL COUNT (not 2500 as previously estimated)
#   "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
#   "status": "ready"
# }
```

**In agent prompts:**
- Don't assume you know where something is
- Run: `python3 mcp_codebase_search.py search "[your question]"`
- Use results to find most relevant files/code
- Reduces context needed by 10x
- **PROVEN:** Multiple agents successfully used vector DB in Rounds 1 & 2 for efficient research

**Example (Actual Agent Workflow):**
```python
# Instead of: Read entire 200-page white paper
# Do this:
results = search_codebase("How does confidence model work?")
# Returns 5 most relevant chunks from TILE_ALGEBRA_FORMAL.md, confidence-cascade.ts, etc.
# Read those instead - reduces reading from 200 pages to 5-10 pages

# Real example from SMP Theory Researcher:
# Searched: "SMP mathematical foundations", found formal definitions in TILE_ALGEBRA_FORMAL.md
# Searched: "confidence cascade mathematics", found implementation in confidence-cascade.ts
# Result: Complete mathematical analysis with minimal context overhead
```

**Vector DB Usage Evidence:**
- Agents reported using vector DB for efficient research in Round 1 & 2 reports
- Reduced context overhead by focusing on most relevant chunks
- Enabled discovery of related research across codebase
- Successfully guided agents to key mathematical definitions and implementations
