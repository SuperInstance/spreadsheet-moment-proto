## Quick Start

### Step 1: Understand Current Phase
Read `research/PHASE_5_PROPOSAL.md` to understand what's planned.

### Step 2: Set Up MCP Servers (REQUIRED for all agents)

The project now includes **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** for cost-effective AI orchestration.

**Why MCP?**
- Unified interface to multiple AI providers
- Pricing-aware model selection (use FREE when possible!)
- Optimized workflows for different tasks
- 50% discount on async batch processing

**Available MCP Servers:**

| Server | Best For | Cost | When to Use |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Groq** | Devil's advocate, rapid iteration | **FREE** | Challenges, quick checks, iterations |
| **DeepInfra** | Research ideation, large context | $0.03-0.20/1M | Novel insights, cost-sensitive work |
| **DeepSeek** | Chain-of-thought reasoning | $0.10/1M | Math proofs, explicit reasoning |
| **Kimi** | Ultra-large context (128K) | $0.12-0.50/1M | Entire papers, synthesis |
| **Alibaba** | Chinese market, Qwen models | $0.02-0.15/1M | Chinese language, Asia deployment |
| **Alibaba DevOps** | ACK, Function Compute | Infrastructure | Kubernetes deployment, CI/CD |

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install all MCP servers
cd mcp-servers/groq-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../deepinfra-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../deepseek-thinker-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../kimi-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../alibaba-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../alibaba-devops-mcp && pip install -e .
```

**Configuration:**
API keys are pre-configured in `claude_mcp_config.json`

**Quick MCP Usage:**

```python
# FREE: Devil's advocate challenge
groq_devils_advocate(
    claim="Your claim here",
    iterations=2
)

# Cheapest: General chat (DeepInfra Mistral 7B)
deepinfra_chat(
    message="Your question",
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"
)

# Complex reasoning: Chain-of-thought
deepseek_reason(
    problem="Mathematical proof needed",
    domain="mathematics",
    steps=7
)

# Large document: Process entire paper
kimi_analyze_document(
    document="[full paper content]",
    analysis_type="summary"
)
```

**Pricing-Aware Workflow (CRITICAL):**

1. **Always start with Groq (FREE)** for rapid iterations
2. **Use cheapest model** that can do the job (DeepInfra Mistral 7B @ $0.03/1M)
3. **Reserve DeepSeek** for explicit chain-of-thought requirements
4. **Use async batching** with Groq for 50% discount on large jobs
5. **Kimi only** when you need 128K context (full papers)

**Async Batching (50% savings!):**

Use Groq async batch when you don't need immediate results:
- Running 10+ simulations in parallel
- Generating multiple hypotheses
- Non-interactive analysis tasks

**See:** `research/MCP_USER_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation

### Step 3: Alibaba Cloud Integration (NEW 2026-03-14)

**Alibaba Cloud API MCP Server**
- **Purpose:** Access Alibaba Cloud's extensive AI and cloud services
- **Best For:** Chinese market deployment, Qwen models, specialized AI services
- **Key Features:**
  - Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen) - Alibaba's large language models
  - Image generation and processing
  - Speech recognition and synthesis
  - Natural language processing for Chinese
  - Machine learning platform (PAI)

**Alibaba Cloud DevOps MCP Server**
- **Purpose:** DevOps automation and deployment for Alibaba Cloud
- **Best For:** CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, monitoring
- **Key Features:**
  - Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK)
  - Function Compute (serverless)
  - Resource Orchestration Service (ROS)
  - Cloud Monitor integration
  - Auto-scaling automation

**Setup:**
```bash
# API key location
apikey/alibaba_api_key.txt

# Install Alibaba MCP servers
cd mcp-servers/alibaba-mcp && pip install -e .
cd ../alibaba-devops-mcp && pip install -e .
```

**Usage Examples:**

**Alibaba Cloud API:**
```python
# Qwen model for Chinese language processing
alibaba_chat(
    message="翻译这段技术文档",

- Pay-as-you-go for optimal cost control

**See:** `mcp-servers/alibaba-mcp/README.md` for complete documentation

### Step 4: Ancient Language Translation Project (NEW 2026-03-14)

**Mission: Cross-Cultural Knowledge Synthesis**

This project expands beyond modern languages to translate SuperInstance papers into **ancient and oral tradition languages** with deep conceptual reconstruction.

**The Challenge:**
Modern technical concepts emerge from Western cultural assumptions (object-oriented, analytical, static). Ancient and indigenous languages often encode different worldviews (process-oriented, relational, holistic).

**Translation Approach: NOT word-for-word, but concept-to-concept**

Example translations:
- "Distributed consensus" → Sanskrit: *Sārasangata* (resonant union through sound)
- "Network protocol" → Chinese: *Lǐ* (ritual propriety, right relationships)
- "Data structure" → Māori: *Whakapapa* (genealogical layering)

**Target Languages & Philosophies:**

| Language | Core Philosophy | Translation Focus |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Sanskrit** | Nada Brahma (World is Sound) | Vibrational resonance |
| **Sumerian** | Cosmic Ordering (The Me) | Divine ordinances |
| **Ancient Hebrew** | Verbal Dynamism (Word = Event) | Speech-act computation |
| **Classical Greek** | Logos (Universal Truth) | Ideal forms |
| **Classical Chinese** | Zhengming (Rectification) | Harmonious relationships |
| **Pacific Islander** | Mana (Breath power) | Ancestral transmission |
| **Indigenous American** | Process Philosophy (80% verbs) | Ongoing becoming |

**Scholars to Study:**
- F. David Peat (Blackfoot physics)
- Dr. Leroy Little Bear (Indigenous metaphysics)
- David Bohm (Wholeness/implicate order)
- Gregory Cajete (Native science)
- John Mbiti (African Sasa/Zamani time)
- Lera Boroditsky (Language & cognition)
- Dr. TK Irwin (Mātauranga Māori)

**Project Structure:**
```
research/cross-cultural-translation/
├── ANCIENT_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md        # Methodology
├── SCHOLAR_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md      # Framework synthesis
├── LANGUAGE_PROFILES/               # Language deep dives
├── CONCEPTUAL_BRIDGES/              # Concept mapping
└── TRANSLATIONS/                    # Actual translations
```

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Read the Scholar Research Summary first
2. Study the Language Profile for your assigned tradition
3. Use Kimi (128K context) for deep research
4. Think IN the target language, not translate FROM English
5. Respect indigenous knowledge sovereignty
6. Document novel computational insights that emerge

**Success Metrics:**
- Cultural fidelity (would native speakers recognize their worldview?)
- Conceptual depth (not word count, but understanding)
- Novel insights (what new perspectives emerge?)
- Knowledge sovereignty (proper attribution)

**See:** `research/cross-cultural-translation/ANCIENT_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md` for complete methodology

### Step 5: SpreadsheetMoment Project (NEW 2026-03-14)

**Mission: Universal Accessibility Through Visual Documentation**

SpreadsheetMoment creates visual documentation that makes complex distributed systems concepts accessible to everyone, from senior engineers to 5th graders.

**Project Philosophy:**
- **Visual-first:** Diagrams and illustrations before text
- **Three-tier strategy:** Different depth for different audiences
- **Iterative refinement:** Multi-model validation for universal appeal
- **Cultural translation:** Name chosen through 8-language research

**Project Structure:**
```
spreadsheet-moment/
├── PROJECT_PLAN.md              # 22-week development timeline
├── docs/
│   ├── NAME_RESEARCH.md         # Name translation research
│   ├── technical/               # Senior engineer documentation (12 pages)
│   ├── general/                 # General audience documentation (12 pages)
│   └── educational/             # 5th grader slide presentation
└── assets/
    └── iterations/              # Image generation iterations
```

**Three Audience Tiers:**

| Tier | Audience | Format | Depth |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Technical** | Senior Engineers | 12-page document | Mathematical rigor, implementation details |
| **General** | Laypeople | 12-page document | Conceptual understanding, real-world analogies |
| **Educational** | 5th Graders | Slide presentation | Visual storytelling, interactive examples |

**Multi-Model Validation Workflow:**

For each image and document:
1. **Create initial version** using Claude Code
2. **Validate with multiple models** via MCP:
   - Groq (FREE) - Quick iteration and devil's advocate
   - DeepInfra - Cost-effective diverse perspectives
   - DeepSeek - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Alibaba Qwen - Cross-cultural appeal check
   - Kimi - Universal accessibility analysis
3. **Iterate** based on feedback
4. **Save all iterations** to `assets/iterations/`

**Image Generation Pipeline:**
```
Concept → 3 versions → Multi-model critique → Refine → Final
```

Example iteration tracking:
```
assets/iterations/
├── distributed_consensus_v1.png
├── distributed_consensus_v1_feedback.md
├── distributed_consensus_v2.png
├── distributed_consensus_v2_feedback.md
└── distributed_consensus_final.png
```

**Content Creation Workflow:**
1. Start with technical document (engineers)
2. Simplify for general audience (maintain accuracy)
3. Create visual narrative for 5th graders
4. Validate each tier with multi-model feedback
5. Ensure "zoom" consistency: deeper detail at each level

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Use MCP calls to multiple models for validation
2. Save all iterations (don't delete early versions)
3. Document feedback and how you addressed it
4. Test with different cultural perspectives (Alibaba, Kimi)
5. Verify 5th grader content actually appeals to that age group

**Success Metrics:**
- Technical accuracy (reviewer approval)
- General accessibility (non-technical person understands)
- Youth engagement (5th grader finds interesting)
- Universal appeal (positive feedback from 3+ cultural perspectives)
- Visual clarity (diagrams stand alone without text)

**Repository:** https://github.com/SuperInstance/spreadsheet-moment
**Project Plan:** `spreadsheet-moment/PROJECT_PLAN.md`

### Step 6: Legacy Multi-API Simulation Tools

The project includes a multi-API simulation framework for research ideation and validation.

**Available APIs:**
- **DeepInfra**: Novel models (Llama 3 70B, Qwen 2 72B, Nemo 340B) for diverse perspectives
- **DeepSeek**: Cost-effective model for rapid iterations and prototyping
- **Moonshot**: High-quality reasoning for critical analysis

**Setup:**
```bash
cd research/simulation_framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Quick Test:**
```bash
python run_mini_ideation.py
```

**Full 5-Phase Simulation:**
```bash
python run_5_phase_simulation.py
```
- Generate research hypotheses using ensemble methods
- Validate claims with multi-model review
- Literature synthesis across different perspectives
- Method development from diverse viewpoints
- Cost-effective iteration with DeepSeek
- Novel insights from different model architectures

**MCP-Powered Best Practices:**
1. Use **Groq (FREE)** for initial exploration and devil's advocate challenges
2. Use **DeepInfra Mistral 7B** ($0.03/1M) for cost-effective ensemble methods
3. Use **DeepSeek** for explicit chain-of-thought when needed
4. Use **async batching** for 50% savings on large simulation batches
5. Save results to `simulation_framework/results/` for tracking
