1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the complete development plan for creating a mask-locked inference chip—a
new category of semiconductor product that physically embeds neural network weights into silicon.
Unlike existing AI chips that load models into memory, our approach bakes model parameters directly
into the hardware fabric, achieving unprecedented efficiency for edge AI deployment. The core
insight driving this initiative is that general-purpose AI hardware (GPUs, NPUs, even specialized
inference chips like Groq's LPU) carries significant overhead from flexibility that many edge
applications simply do not need. By sacrificing the ability to run arbitrary models, we gain order-of-
magnitude improvements in power efficiency, cost, and simplicity—making local AI inference
practical for billions of devices that cannot currently support it.

1.1 The Core Proposition
Consider the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB, currently the gold standard for edge AI development.
At approximately $250, it delivers roughly 20-30 tokens per second on a 7B-parameter model after
significant software optimization, consuming 10-15 watts in the process. The user must install
JetPack, configure CUDA drivers, manage memory allocation, and accept that half the hardware cost
goes toward flexibility they will never use. Our proposition is simple: for the same $250, could we
deliver a device that runs the same model at 3-5x the throughput, using one-third the power, with zero
software setup? Not a computer running software—just pure inference hardware that plugs in and
works.

1.2 Market Timing
Three converging trends make this the right moment for mask-locked inference chips. First, small
language models (SLMs) in the 1B-7B parameter range have achieved sufficient capability for most
edge use cases—the models are 'good enough' that freezing them in silicon is no longer a
compromise. Second, privacy regulations worldwide are pushing computation away from clouds and
toward local devices, creating demand for air-gapped inference. Third, the edge AI chip market is
projected to grow from $3.67 billion in 2025 to $11.54 billion by 2030, but current solutions force
developers to choose between expensive general-purpose hardware or severely limited
microcontrollers. We are creating the middle ground.


2. Competitive Landscape Analysis
Understanding what others are building is essential for positioning our differentiation. The AI chip
landscape has several distinct approaches, each with inherent tradeoffs that create the market void we
intend to fill.

2.1 General-Purpose Inference Chips
NVIDIA Jetson series (Orin Nano, Orin NX, AGX Orin) represents the current standard for edge AI
development. These devices combine GPU cores, CPU cores, and unified memory to run any model
the user loads. The flexibility comes at a steep cost: a Jetson Orin Nano at $250 spends perhaps 30-
40% of its silicon area on features a typical inference workload never uses. Power consumption
ranges from 7W to 40W depending on configuration, with significant overhead from the Linux OS,
CUDA runtime, and Python interpreter stack. Setup time for a production inference pipeline can range
from days to weeks. This is the baseline we must beat on price-performance while offering
dramatically simpler deployment.

2.2 Inference-Optimized Processors
Groq's Language Processing Unit (LPU) takes a different approach. Built on a 14nm process, the LPU
achieves impressive throughput by using hundreds of megabytes of on-chip SRAM for weight storage
and deterministic, software-defined scheduling. A Groq LPU can deliver Llama-2 70B at 300 tokens
per second—ten times faster than NVIDIA H100 clusters. However, Groq's architecture still loads
models from external memory. The weights reside in SRAM rather than DRAM, which eliminates
memory bandwidth bottlenecks, but they are not hardwired into the silicon. Each chip can run any
compatible model, which means the flexibility overhead remains. Groq is targeting data center
inference, not edge devices, and their pricing reflects this positioning.

2.3 Architecture-Specific ASICs
Etched's Sohu chip represents the closest existing concept to our vision. Announced in June 2024 with
a $120 million Series A, Sohu is an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit designed specifically for
transformer models. Manufactured on TSMC's 4nm process, Etched claims 20x speedup over
NVIDIA H100 for transformer inference. The critical difference from our approach: Sohu is
optimized for the transformer architecture but still loads model weights from memory. It can run any
transformer model, making it fundamentally more flexible—and more expensive—than what we are
building. Etched targets cloud/datacenter inference where customers want to run the latest open-
source models on optimized hardware. Our market is the opposite: edge devices where customers
want one specific model, frozen, running forever without updates.

2.4 Low-Power Edge NPUs
Companies like Kneron, Hailo, and Syntiant produce neural processing units designed for edge
inference with extremely low power consumption. Kneron's KL530 achieves 1 TOPS at INT4
precision with under 1W power draw. Hailo's H8 processor delivers 26 TOPS at 2.5W. Syntiant's
NDP102 targets always-on voice applications at milliwatt power levels. These chips excel at
computer vision and keyword spotting but lack the memory capacity and computational throughput
for meaningful language model inference. They represent the current state of edge AI—powerful
enough for CNNs and tiny transformers, but fundamentally unsuited for the 1B+ parameter models
that make local LLM inference useful.

2.5 The Competitive Gap
The market lacks a product that combines meaningful LLM capability with edge-appropriate power
consumption and zero software complexity. General-purpose chips are too expensive and power-
hungry. Inference-optimized chips target data centers, not edge devices. Low-power NPUs cannot run
models large enough to be useful. And no one is hardwiring model weights into silicon, which is the
step change in efficiency we intend to exploit.


3. Technical Architecture
3.1 The Mask-Locked Concept
Traditional chips store neural network weights in memory—either DRAM for large models or SRAM
for smaller ones. During inference, weights are fetched from memory to compute units, creating a
fundamental bottleneck: memory bandwidth limits throughput, and memory access consumes power.
A mask-locked chip eliminates this bottleneck by encoding weights directly into the silicon's metal
interconnect layers. The weights become permanent physical structures, like the logic gates
themselves, rather than data stored in memory cells. This approach, recently validated by academic
research on 'Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Units' (HNLPU), can achieve 41-80x
improvement in cost-effectiveness and 357x reduction in carbon footprint compared to H100 clusters
for inference workloads.



                                             Page 3 of 10
                                                               Mask-Locked Inference Chip — Developer Plan



Key Technical Insight
When a weight is stored in memory, reading it for computation requires: (1) activating a memory row,
(2) sensing the stored charge, (3) driving the data across the memory bus, and (4) routing it to the
compute unit. Each step consumes energy and introduces latency. When the weight is hardwired into
metal, it is always 'present' at the compute unit—zero access latency, zero access energy, infinite
bandwidth. The tradeoff is that changing weights requires fabricating a new chip. For edge inference
with stable models, this tradeoff is enormously favorable.

3.2 Architectural Components
    1. Hardwired Weight Matrix: The transformer's attention and feed-forward weights encoded
       directly in metal routing. For a 3B parameter model at INT4 precision (2 bits per weight), this
       requires approximately 6 billion bits of 'storage' distributed across the compute fabric. Unlike
       memory, this storage has no area overhead beyond the metal routing that must exist anyway.
    2. Matrix Multiply Units: systolic arrays optimized for the specific dimensions of the target
       model's weight matrices. Because dimensions are fixed, we can size arrays precisely without
       the flexibility overhead of programmable architectures.
    3. Activation SRAM: A small amount of on-chip SRAM (megabytes, not gigabytes) for storing
       intermediate activations, KV cache, and input/output buffers. This is the only mutable state in
       the system.
    4. Control Logic: A minimal finite state machine to sequence operations. No CPU, no operating
       system, no software stack. The control logic is hardwired to execute one specific inference
       pattern.
    5. I/O Interface: Simple USB, PCIe, or M.2 interface for input (prompt tokens) and output
       (generated tokens). The chip appears as a simple peripheral—send text in, get text out.

3.3 Process Node Selection
The choice of semiconductor manufacturing process is critical for cost and capability. Leading-edge
nodes (TSMC 4nm, 3nm) offer the highest transistor density but carry enormous non-recurring
engineering (NRE) costs—mask sets alone can exceed $10 million. For mask-locked chips targeting
price-sensitive edge markets, mature nodes offer a better cost proposition. A 28nm or 40nm process
provides sufficient density for small language models while keeping NRE costs in the $2-4 million
range. The slightly larger die size is acceptable because we are not competing on raw performance;
we are competing on price-performance-per-watt for edge inference. The Google TPU was originally
built on 28nm, demonstrating that inference accelerators do not require cutting-edge processes.

3.4 Quantization Strategy
To fit meaningful models in reasonable silicon area, aggressive quantization is essential. Research
shows that 4-bit quantization (INT4) can achieve quality within 1-2% of FP16 for inference while
reducing model size by 4x. More aggressive approaches like 2-bit or binary quantization are active
research areas that could enable larger models in the same silicon area. Our architecture should
support INT4 as a baseline with optional INT2 for specific layers. The fixed-function nature of the
chip means we can apply layer-specific quantization strategies that would be impractical for general-
purpose inference engines.


4. Implementation Roadmap
4.1 Phase 1: Feasibility & Simulation (Months 1-6)
Before committing to silicon, we must validate the approach through rigorous simulation and
modeling. This phase answers the fundamental question: can we achieve the claimed efficiency gains
with real models and real workloads?


                                              Page 4 of 10

    1. Model Selection: Identify target models for first-generation chips. Candidates include
       Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-3-mini (3.8B), and Gemma-2-2B. Selection criteria: capability at small
       size, inference efficiency, licensing terms for commercial embedding.
    2. Quantization Study: Implement and evaluate INT4 and INT2 quantization for candidate
       models. Measure quality degradation on standard benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag,
       GSM8K). Target: <2% quality loss from FP16 baseline.
    3. Architecture Simulation: Build a cycle-accurate simulator for the mask-locked architecture.
       Model power consumption, throughput, and latency. Validate against FPGA prototype if
       resources permit.
    4. Area Estimation: Using synthesis tools and target PDK (process design kit), estimate die area
       for different model sizes. Determine which models fit in economically viable die sizes.
    5. Cost Modeling: Develop detailed cost models including NRE (masks, design, verification)
       and per-unit manufacturing cost. Establish pricing targets for different market segments.

4.2 Phase 2: Design & Verification (Months 7-18)
With feasibility established, this phase develops the complete RTL design and verification
infrastructure. ASIC design is unforgiving—bugs discovered after tapeout cannot be patched in
software.
    1. RTL Development: Write synthesizable Verilog/SystemVerilog or Chisel (Scala-based
         hardware construction language) for all architectural components. Chisel offers advantages
         for parameterized designs that we can leverage for different model sizes.
    2. Weight Integration: Develop tooling to convert trained model weights into Verilog constants
         or memory initialization files. This is the core innovation—automating the translation from
         PyTorch checkpoint to hardware description.
    3. Functional Verification: Build comprehensive testbenches covering all inference scenarios.
         Verify correctness against software reference implementation for thousands of test cases.
    4. Formal Verification: Apply formal methods to prove correctness of critical paths and control
         logic. Ensure no deadlock or livelock conditions exist in the state machine.
    5. FPGA Prototyping: Map the design to a high-end FPGA (Xilinx Versal or Intel Stratix) for
         real-world validation. This is the last chance to catch bugs before committing to silicon.

4.3 Phase 3: Physical Design & Tapeout (Months 19-24)
Physical design transforms the RTL into geometric layout ready for manufacturing. This phase
requires specialized EDA tools and expertise.
    1. Synthesis: Convert RTL to gate-level netlist using target technology library. Optimize for
        timing, area, and power targets.
    2. Place & Route: Physical layout of gates and interconnects. This is where weight encoding
        becomes physical—the metal routing patterns that represent model parameters.
    3. Timing Closure: Ensure all paths meet timing constraints at target clock frequency across
        process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners.
    4. Design Rule Check (DRC) & Layout vs Schematic (LVS): Verify the design complies with
        all manufacturing rules and matches the intended circuit.
    5. Tapeout: Submit final GDSII files to foundry for mask fabrication. First silicon expected 2-4
        months after tapeout depending on foundry schedule.

4.4 Phase 4: Validation & Production (Months 25-30)
Receiving first silicon is a milestone, not a finish line. Extensive validation ensures the chip functions
correctly and meets specifications.

    1. Bring-up: Initial power-on and basic functionality verification. Test I/O interfaces, clock
       distribution, and power management.
    2. Functional Validation: Run inference test suites comparing chip output to software reference.
       Verify accuracy across temperature and voltage ranges.
    3. Performance Characterization: Measure actual throughput, latency, and power consumption.
       Compare to simulated predictions.
    4. Reliability Testing: Accelerated life testing, thermal cycling, and ESD validation to ensure
       field reliability.
    5. Production Ramp: Work with assembly and test partners to establish production flow.
       Develop test programs for high-volume manufacturing.


5. Team Requirements & Organization
5.1 Core Team Structure
Building a mask-locked inference chip requires a multidisciplinary team spanning AI/ML, digital
design, physical implementation, and software. Unlike software startups where small teams can iterate
rapidly, ASIC development requires specialized expertise that cannot be easily acquired or
substituted.

5.2 Critical Expertise Areas
Certain expertise areas are non-negotiable for ASIC success. Without experienced guidance in these
domains, the project carries unacceptable risk of costly mistakes.
    • Transformer Architecture Expertise: Deep understanding of attention mechanisms, layer
        normalization, and transformer variants. Required for making informed decisions about
        hardware-software tradeoffs.
    • ASIC Design Flow: Experience with complete design flow from RTL to GDSII using
        industry-standard tools (Cadence, Synopsys, or open-source alternatives like OpenROAD).
    • Memory Design: Understanding of SRAM design and memory compiler usage for activation
        storage. May need custom memory instances for optimal density.
    • Low-Power Design: Techniques for minimizing dynamic and static power consumption.
        Essential for edge applications with strict power budgets.

    •   Foundry Interface: Experience working with foundries (TSMC, GlobalFoundries, etc.),
        understanding design rules, and navigating tapeout procedures.

5.3 Outsourcing vs. In-House
For a lean startup, certain functions should be outsourced while core competencies remain in-house.
RTL design and architecture are core competencies—these define the product's unique value. Physical
design can be partially outsourced to design service companies, though maintaining in-house
capability is valuable for iteration speed. Packaging, testing, and production engineering are typically
outsourced to specialized vendors. Verification should be primarily in-house but can be augmented
with contractor support for testbench development.


6. Business Model & Economics
6.1 The Hardware-as-Intelligence Model
Traditional AI businesses follow a subscription model: customers pay monthly for access to
continuously improving models. Our model inverts this: customers pay once for a fixed-capability
chip, and 'upgrades' mean buying new hardware. This is not a bug—it is the core value proposition.
Planned obsolescence through model evolution creates a natural upgrade cycle that benefits both
customer (access to better models) and business (recurring revenue through hardware generations).
Consider the analogy to smartphone upgrades: people do not resent buying new phones every 2-3
years because the new models offer genuinely better experiences. We are creating the same dynamic
for AI inference hardware.

6.2 Cost Structure Analysis
Understanding the cost structure is essential for pricing and market positioning. The total cost of an
ASIC project has two components: Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and per-unit manufacturing
cost.
           Cost Component                           28nm Node                            40nm Node
 Mask Set (NRE)                                     $2-3 million                       $1-1.5 million
 Design & Verification (NRE)                        $2-4 million                       $1.5-3 million
 Prototype (MPW shuttle)                            $100-300K                             $50-150K
 Die Cost (per unit @ 10K volume)                      $8-15                                $6-10
 Packaging & Test (per unit)                            $3-5                                $2-4
 Total Unit Cost @ 10K volume                          $11-20                               $8-14
                           Table 2: Estimated Development and Manufacturing Costs

6.3 Pricing Strategy
Our pricing targets the gap between microcontrollers ($1-10) and edge compute modules ($150-300).
A mask-locked 3B-parameter inference chip should sell for $30-60 at retail, positioning it as an
affordable upgrade for devices that need AI capability but cannot justify the cost and complexity of a
Jetson-class module. At this price point and estimated unit cost, gross margins of 50-60% are
achievable—healthy for hardware while remaining competitive. Volume discounts for OEM
integration would push ASP (average selling price) lower but accelerate market adoption.

6.4 Product Line Strategy
A multi-product line captures different market segments while sharing design infrastructure:

7. Risk Analysis & Mitigation
7.1 Technical Risks
Model Obsolescence (High Risk): The primary technical risk is that our frozen model becomes
outdated before the chip reaches market. If a new model architecture or training breakthrough renders
our target model obsolete, the chip loses value. Mitigation: Choose models with proven stability
(Llama family, established architectures) rather than bleeding-edge models. Design architecture to
support multiple model variants through configuration rather than hardwiring all details. Maintain
flexibility in output layers and tokenization.
Quantization Quality Loss (Medium Risk): Aggressive quantization required for efficient
implementation may degrade model quality unacceptably. Mitigation: Extensive quantization research
in Phase 1 before committing to silicon. Consider mixed-precision approaches where critical layers
retain higher precision. Partner with quantization researchers and leverage latest techniques.
First-Silicon Bugs (Medium Risk): Despite rigorous verification, ASICs often have bugs discovered
only in silicon. Mitigation: Comprehensive FPGA prototyping before tapeout. Design in debug/trace
infrastructure for post-silicon validation. Budget for potential respin in financial planning.

7.2 Market Risks
Competitive Response (High Risk): If the concept proves successful, well-funded competitors (Groq,
Etched, Tenstorrent) could enter the mask-locked segment. Mitigation: First-mover advantage in
establishing the category. Focus on edge markets that larger players may neglect. Build brand
recognition as the 'edge inference specialist.'
Model Licensing (Medium Risk): Some model providers may restrict embedding weights in
hardware. Mitigation: Focus on models with permissive licenses (Llama, Mistral, Apache-2.0 licensed
models). Develop relationships with model providers for explicit embedding permission.
Customer Adoption (Medium Risk): Edge developers may resist 'frozen' capability chips, preferring
flexibility even when unnecessary. Mitigation: Education and documentation showing the value
proposition. Developer tools that abstract away the fixed nature. Clear upgrade path messaging.

7.3 Execution Risks
Team Assembly (High Risk): Finding experienced ASIC engineers in a competitive market is
challenging. Mitigation: Consider acquiring or partnering with an existing chip design team. Offer
compelling equity packages. Leverage semiconductor incubators (Silicon Catalyst) for access to
experienced mentors.
Funding Gaps (High Risk): ASIC development requires significant capital before revenue. Mitigation:
Phased approach with clear milestones for each funding round. Government programs (CHIPS Act,
SBIR/STTR) for early-stage funding. Strategic partnerships with companies that need edge AI
capability.

8. Key Strategic Decisions & Reasoning
Throughout this document, certain decisions require explicit reasoning to guide future choices as
circumstances evolve.

8.1 Why Mask-Locked vs. FPGA or eFPGA?
FPGAs offer reconfigurability that seems attractive—why not use programmable logic that can be
updated when models improve? The answer lies in efficiency. FPGAs pay a 10-50x overhead in
power and area compared to ASICs for the same function. An FPGA implementation of a 3B model
would require a $500+ device consuming 20-30W, defeating our cost and power targets. eFPGA
(embedded FPGA IP in an ASIC) provides partial reconfigurability but adds complexity and area
overhead for limited benefit—our customers want simplicity, not configurability. Mask-locking is the
right tradeoff for edge inference where the model is stable and efficiency is paramount.

8.2 Why Target Edge Rather Than Data Center?
Data center inference chips (Etched Sohu, Groq LPU) compete directly with NVIDIA in a market
where performance-per-dollar dominates decision-making. NVIDIA's software ecosystem, developer
familiarity, and continuous improvement make dislodging them extremely difficult. Edge inference is
a different market with different constraints: power consumption, physical size, thermal budget, and
software simplicity matter more than raw throughput. The edge market is underserved and fragmented
—exactly the conditions where a focused startup can establish beachhead before larger players notice.
Once we have proven the concept and built manufacturing expertise, expanding toward data center
products becomes viable.

8.3 Why Not Build a More Flexible Architecture?
Flexibility seems like it would expand our market—why limit ourselves to one model? The reasoning
is threefold. First, flexibility has concrete costs in die area, power, and complexity that compound to
make the product uncompetitive. Second, our value proposition is simplicity: plug in, it works, no
software stack to manage. Adding flexibility re-introduces the software complexity we aim to
eliminate. Third, the 'planned obsolescence' model only works if each chip generation offers
meaningfully better intelligence. A flexible chip undermines our own upgrade cycle. We are not
building a chip that runs AI—we are building a chip that IS AI.

8.4 Why Mature Process Nodes (28nm/40nm)?
Leading-edge processes (4nm, 3nm) offer higher density and better performance-per-watt, but the
economics do not work for our target price points. A 4nm mask set costs $15-20 million—
unaffordable for a first-generation startup product. More importantly, our efficiency gains come from
architectural innovation (mask-locking), not process technology. A mask-locked design on 40nm will
dramatically outperform a conventional design on 4nm for inference workloads because we eliminate
the memory bottleneck entirely. Mature nodes also have better availability, more design service
options, and lower risk of supply constraints.


9. Resources & Next Steps
9.1 Immediate Actions (First 90 Days)
    1. Team Recruitment: Identify and recruit the Architecture Lead—the most critical hire who will
       guide technical decisions through the entire project. This person should have experience
       shipping ASICs, ideally for AI/ML applications.

    2. Incubator Application: Apply to Silicon Catalyst, the premier semiconductor startup
       incubator. Acceptance provides access to EDA tools (Cadence, Synopsys), foundry
       relationships, and experienced mentors.
    3. Model Evaluation: Begin systematic evaluation of candidate models for first-generation chip.
       Establish benchmarks and quality thresholds for quantization studies.
    4. Open-Source Toolchain Evaluation: Assess open-source EDA tools (OpenROAD, Yosys,
       Magic) for feasibility in early development stages. This can reduce initial costs while
       maintaining path to commercial tools.
    5. Funding Strategy: Develop pitch materials for seed funding and government grants (CHIPS
       Act, NSF SBIR). Early capital is essential for team building and Phase 1 execution.

9.3 Critical Questions to Resolve
As development proceeds, these questions will guide strategic decisions:
    1. Model Licensing: Can we legally embed specific models (Llama, Phi, Gemma) in hardware?
       What agreements are required from model providers?
    2. Quantization Limits: What is the minimum precision that maintains acceptable quality for our
       target use cases? Can 2-bit quantization work?
    3. Interface Choice: USB, PCIe, M.2, or custom form factor? What do edge developers actually
       want to plug into their devices?
    4. Foundry Selection: TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, or others? Balance of cost,
       availability, design support, and IP ecosystem.
    5. First Market: Which edge segment offers the fastest path to revenue—DIY/maker, industrial
       IoT, automotive, or consumer electronics?


10. Conclusion
The mask-locked inference chip represents a new category of semiconductor product: intelligence as a
physical component rather than a software service. By sacrificing flexibility for efficiency, we can
deliver local AI inference at price points and power levels that enable entirely new categories of
applications. The market timing is favorable, the technical approach is validated by recent research,
and the competitive landscape has a clear gap we can fill. Success requires assembling a world-class
team, executing flawlessly on ASIC development, and educating the market about a new way to think
about AI deployment. This document provides the roadmap—the work begins now.
